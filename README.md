# Horiseon Social Media Marketing Challenge

This project is an on-the-job ticket which required me to refactor the code and add in accessibility features to ensure the webiste is optimized for search engines. I did this by updating the provided html and css files. 

Some of the changes include:
    - Adding alt attributes to all images
    - Adding in semantic elements to ensure SEO
    - Removed unnecessary code
    - Consolidated CSS selectors and properties
    - Added comments to make code more readable
